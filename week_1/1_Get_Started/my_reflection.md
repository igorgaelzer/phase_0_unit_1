## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience.
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I didn`t have any struggles setting up Git or Github as I had them previously installed. I used a very good tutorial that guided me through each step and it worked just fine.

Git is a version control management tool that can be used to keep track of multiple versions of your code, although it has many uses in different areas. Git allows you to work with other programmers on the same code, at the same time, and it will merge all changes perfectly once they are committed, managing any conflicts that might have occurred. Git will also allow you to roll back to an earlier version in case something goes wrong and your code stops working, or in case you just want to check how the code evolved util it became what it is currently.  Git works locally and saves your versions in your local hard drive.

Github, in the other hand, it is an online service for uploading your commits, or changes, to the cloud. That has many benefits as it allows you to work with remote teams very easlily, you can access your code from anywhere, share it, have people commenting it and helping you when you are stuck. The important thing to understand is that Git and Github are different things, even though they work tightly together, and for you code to appear on Github you need to push it from your local Git.

Most, if not all, developers use some kind of version control system, being Git the most popular of them. It makes total sense to me to use such a system as code can, and it will, become always more complex, and things will go wrong. Having a version control system will just give you the security to try new things without breaking everything to the point there is no turning back. With a version control system there is always a way back to where things were working fine, no matter what kind of mistake anybody on the team has made.

It all makes a lot of sense to me and I`m glad people have come up with such a powerfull tool to manage this hard task, that is keeping track and compatibility in changing files, while multiple people are working on them at the same time.
