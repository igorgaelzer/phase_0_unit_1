* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?

I knew most of it already, but the content did clarify some things I had not thought of much before, like the difference of Internet and web.

* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?

Getting a domain name, a host, defining layout, content and if you are going to get a programmer to do it or do it yourself.

* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?

It`s an easy page. I've done more complex ones.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

Not really at this stage.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Nope. This was pretty basic for me.
