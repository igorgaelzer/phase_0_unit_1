* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't?

It really makes sense to me that content and styles are separate. That way, content is structured by it`s meaning, importance or role, wich is good for search engines and organizing the Internet. Also, that way you can change the look of an entire site with just a few ajustments on the CSS instead of finding and changing every element individually.

* What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML seems very easy and the good part is that, oposed to Ruby, for example, it won`t make the whole thing stop working because of an error. I really enjoy the fact that you can make little changes in the code and immediately see the impacts of it on the look of the page.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

Not now as I`ve known this for a while, but I always wondered why the heck stylesheets were in a different file. It makes total sense now.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Nope! I`ve taken several HTML/CSS tutorials before. Nothing really new at this point.
