Hello Gunnari, Ian and Jessica!

How was your first week of preparation?

My name is Igor Gaelzer and I`m from Brazil. My favorite sites are Medium, Tuts+ and Mailchimp.

My thinking style is Abstract Random and my learning style is multimodal.

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

I`m very excited about this and I see most of us have similar fears about the course, but mostly because people just wanna get it right. It makes me feel like this is not something easy to anybody and that we can all help each other.
