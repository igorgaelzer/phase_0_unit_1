* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

I think responsive design is a great practice, as it avoids having to build and maintain several different websites for each screen size and device, while still making it adaptable and easy to visualize in all of them.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

I think that along with responsive design, we've seen an increase in minimalistic design, which has the pros of having less elements to adapt to different screens and also it tends to load faster in devices with less processing power. I think it's going to be more and more about content from now on, put in a base that is flexible, without much bells and wistles.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

Visually impaired people do use the web and they usually do so with tools that will read the content on screen for them, like VoiceOver. I think it`s important we design our sites for them.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

I couldn't think of anything that seems stupid or doesn't reasonate right now.

No.
