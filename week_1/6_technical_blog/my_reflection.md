Blog url: http://igorgaelzer.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I really enjoyed making this blog as I was excited to actually start building things. I did not find it cumbersome as all the necessary information on how to code it was previously given and well explained. I felt best about designing my own blog as minimalisticly and focused on content as my favorite sites. I'm actually very happy with the end result and I think the blog will be a great way to keep track of the learnings and fix them in my mind.
