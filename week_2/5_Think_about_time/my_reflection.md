# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?

My biggest time management challenge during phase 0 was being able to really understand the things I was being introduced and how they work, and reading all the articles suggested while still being able to deliver the expected work in time. I did catch myself working until the very lasts minutes of week 1 and thinking "I won`t be able to make it!!!"

------------------------------

* How will you combat that?

I`ve adopted a new approach, specially with the reading material, where I kinda browse through the content, try to understand what is really important for now, and move on to the tasks and assignments until I get what I have to do done. Then, if there is time remaining, I can go back and dive deeper into the content, read it in my phone anywhere and understand it better, without pressure or due dates as I can catch up the reading in the next week with no problemns.

I do wish I could allow myself to dive deeply into the content while I'm at the tasks, but even though I'm putting in a lot of hours, it is A LOT of content and reading all of it with the attention I'd like AND delivering the assignments in the expected due dates just isn't an option.

------------------------------

* What techniques will you try?

I'm using the pomodoro technique and I guess separating the fundamental from the important, doing the fundamental first and then going back to the important later would be a technique too.

------------------------------

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

I wanna get prepared to kick ass at DBC so I can use use the time there producing the best work possible with the great people I know I will meet there. The plan is to use my time the best possible way, get things done and deliver.
