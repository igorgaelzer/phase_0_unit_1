* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I already knew most things here. Positioning is is the hardest to get right though. Just did checked some references on Google that I tryed until I got it to work.

* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  

The hardest part to understand, for me, was positioning the elemments on the screen.

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

Yes, that there is a relation between the behavior of relative and absolute positioned blocks. I can set an absolute position inside of a relative object, for example.

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?

Pretty confident. The positioning thing will need some practice but I'm sure it'll be easy to get right with a little experience.

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

I really enjoy going ahead and building things. Seeing the things in my head becomming reality is what excites me the most.

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Nothing was tedious... I`m just glad we are getting to build things. I feel well prepared!
