# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

As far as I understood, the DOM allows you to modify any tag or code in the HTML and it allows pages to be dynamic, not just a static documents. The bad thing about it is that apparently it still has some inconsistencies.


* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

They are basicly the same thing, but the wordpress blog is way more complex, it has many more source files and elements on the page.


* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

I find it very helpful. It`s not something I would call fun or boring, but very usefull when you need it.


* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

Not really as I already knew the concepts of this.


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

No.
