* Post example: http://igorgaelzer.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Discuss the following:

* What did you learn about design and user experience?

I learned a lot about how to make the code efficient, how to reduce divs, how to use semantic tags, how to position the elements on the screen and etc.

------------------------------

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I love design and user experience, even though ic can take a while to get it right. Planning and working on the site was really fun. I really like learning by doing, or getting a feel of the problem before studying the solution, as opposed to learning about all possible problems I may encounter before even starting the work or understandng the real problem.

------------------------------

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

First I asked myself a couple questions about who is going to access the site and what it is for. Then I made a wireframe and went ahead to developement. I noticed that, while developing, I changed the wireframe a little as I found better ways of doing things. I guess most things worked as expected. On thing I had problems with is when updating an element in one page, I had to manually update it in all others, which was kind of a pain to make sure they all have the same text, links, formatting and etc.

------------------------------

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

I would love to use a MVC (model, view, controller) structure on it so I can update elements only once for the change to be applied to all pages.

------------------------------

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

I had several little problems along the way and I did do little researches as "How to remove bullets from an unordered list", but mostly it went just fine. I really enjoyed getting my header and sidebar with a fixed position working well with the rest of the site.

------------------------------

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Nothing special, just some quick stack overflow searches on quick doubts I had.
