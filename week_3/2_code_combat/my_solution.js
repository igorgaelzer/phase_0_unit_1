// Reflection:

/*

What is this referring to? Think programming-wise rather than in the terms of the game.
It allows an object to be called outside of a function.

What does the () do in JavaScript?
It says that the word before it is a function and it holds it's properties.

What is the point of the semicolons?
It tells the computer that is the end of that command.


What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
It was hard to figure out what the game wanted you to do, not the code or logic itself.


What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
n/a


What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
I understood it all.


Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
No.


How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
Ok.


Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
I did not enjoy this challenge.


Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
There was so much to do this week and this is so basic and time consuming that I got frustrated having to do this while there is so much waiting to be done yet.
