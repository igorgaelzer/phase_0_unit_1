## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  

#### add
Adding a file to Git make is be seen, or it's changes tracked, by it. You have to add the files you want to send to your repository later.

#### branch
Branching a file is basically making a independent copy of where you can work on separetely. This is commonly used when working on bigger teams, or if you want to get a open source code and you wanna make adaptations on it so it works for your needs.

#### checkout
This is a navigational command for you to see what is inside a certain directory, like *git checkout master*

#### clone
Is used to clone a repository to your computer so you can see and work on the files locally.

#### commit
Commit is one of the most important commands in git, it gets your files and changes made in them and commits them, or sends them, to your repository.

#### fetch
Fetching is updating the local files with the changes made in the remote repository.

#### log
Git logs are used to find specific commits in a project history.

#### merge
Merge is used to bring together the changes that you and the other team members have made to the files.

#### pull
To get the most updated version of your repository.

#### push
Pushing changes on your local files is committing them to the remote repository.

#### reset
I found this hard to understand, even though I've looked through different sources of information. Looks likr it has something to do with going back to previous versions of the code.

#### rm
It's used to remove files from git control. As I understand it it's the opposite to *git add*

#### status
Shows the status of the files added to git and if they are being followed or not and if they are on stage and ready to be committed.
