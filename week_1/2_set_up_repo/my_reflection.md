* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person

Basically you have to create a "folder" inside your profile on Github`s website, this is called a repository. Once that is done, you will copy that folder to your local drive, and all the changes in the files inside it, like updates on your code, will be pushed to Github once you tell it to do so.

* Describe what open source means

There are many types of open source licenses, each with different levels of permissions, but basically when a software is open source anybody has access to it`s raw/source code, instead of just it`s output, and that way people can change it the way they like it, collaborate to it making it better to all other users, distribute independent versions and even sell them.

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think it is great for specific uses. If you are a small/medium company trying to offer great and specific software solutions to your clients, I don`t think open source is the option as you will be investing money on those solutions and there needs to be a return on it. When open sourced, anybody could copy and use that software without the need to pay you for you work.

* Assess the importance of using licenses

Using licenses is important so you define what can and can not be done with that code. Most importantly, it protects you as the creator, giving you the credit for helping the community and avoiding that someone else takes the credit for it as it were theirs.

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Not really, as I already had a repository set up for Github Pages. I do think it is amazing though and I did get a better understanding of the types of open source licences.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I did not need to look for extra resources on this step.
