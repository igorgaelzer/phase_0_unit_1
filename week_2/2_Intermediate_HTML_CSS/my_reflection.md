* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

I think they are great, specially because of semantics, so we can better organize the Internet.

-------------------------------

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

It does make sense, as the words used for the tags are very easy to relate. They actually make the code easier to understand reducing the amount of divs.

-------------------------------

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

Yes, I do, as I explained in the question above. I think the name describe well their function.

-------------------------------

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

It`s used to reset the default format and spacing the browser gives to the elements so you don't have to deal with finding spaces, borders, padding and etc that you did not want.

-------------------------------

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

I have used many browsers during my life, starting with IE, then Firefox, then Chrome, then Safari (once I bought a Mac). I believe browser compatibility issues are really bad as they make programmers have to test their work and improve it so it works in many different browsers. I think incompatibility used to be way worse than it is today though.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

No.
