* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

I`ve been prototyping sites and apps for a while. Nothing really new.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I love design and UX. It was fun, but a lot of work to squeeze into the time I had available.

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I had to do this quicly. I did not have any specific questions, but once I have more time I will definitely go deeper into wireframing to understand the best practices more deeply.

* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?

Should you use text that is going to be show on the site, like actually writing your value proposition on the wireframe, or should you just write something like "Here goes the value proposition"?

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

Not really at this point.

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?

Medium high. I just wish I had a little longer to go deeper into this. I wasn't expecting/prepared to put in so many hours! I didn't think it would take that long to get all this weeks stuff done.

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

I like design and UX in general.

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I like wireframing, but I prefer it when I am creating. Just reproducing the wireframes of 3 existing sites when time is very limited was a bit tedious.
